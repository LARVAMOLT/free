# Free Stuff

Repo for free-to-copy little thingies I've made.
Usually just HTML and CSS with occasional simple scripts for randomized text.

Hosted here as backup of the versions on Neocities since I don't trust Pastebin.

You are free to copy, paste, modify, and adapt any of this stuff. Just retain
the credit to me, and more importantly, retain any credit to larger corporations
that can actually afford lawyers.

Don't adapt any of this into something illegal, evil, or malicious.

Don't redistribute the code yourself (why bro) unless I'm dead. Just link people here.

Thanks! Enjoy!
