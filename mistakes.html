common mistakes i am constantly relearning:

<br>margin: auto (centering a div) doesn't work unless you declare display:block first

<br>.word is a class
<br>#word is an ID
<br>
i have googled "is a hashtag a class or id" probably five hundred times atp.

<br>box-sizing: border-box; is the most wonderful thing you can start any div or container with. just do it.
